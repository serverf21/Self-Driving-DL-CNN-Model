# Self-Driving-DL-CNN-Model

In this project, I implemented Nvidia's deep learning methodologies and built a model which can take in the data of right, left, and central camera images from the car, preprocess it, and use it to drive a car autnomously without a driver.

I used Python's frameworks and libraries such as numpy, tensorflow (by Google), Keras and openCV to build the model. Furthermore, I used socketio to establish the connection of our model with the udacity simulator on localhost and the car drove autonomously.

The last results of this model showed a 92.47 % of efficiency in detecting the turns. I am still studying about the hypertuning and optimizing techniques. 

Feel free to contribute and connect with me on similar projects.
